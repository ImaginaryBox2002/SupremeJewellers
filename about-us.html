            <p> For the past three generations, the Midas family has been producing fine designer jewelry. A family tradition that can be 		traced back to our South African origins. </p>
    
            <br>
    
            <p> Even in this day and age of mass production, each of our designs reflects the individual flair and creativity of the 			craftsman. We see this as an essential part of our production process and our responsibility to you, our clients.</p>
    
            <br>
    
            <p> SUPREME JEWELLERS first opened its doors in September 1969, under the direction of Mr. J Midas. The first location was a retail store on Peacock Street, Lenasia , with manufacturing facilities directly above. </p>
